# NOTE

# This script downloads from aws s3 bucket, the packages you have uploaded from the jenkins job
# and sign them. It uploads the source package to TEST_PPA on launchpad from where you can 
# install and check if everything is working fine and as expected.

# USAGE: ./sign_and_upload.sh KEYID

# For this script,
# you are expected to have the key imported on to your system and supply the key-ID.
# 
# To get the KEY-ID,
# 1. Import the secret key associated with your launchpad account into this computer
# using the below command
# gpg --allow-secret-key-import --import path/secret.key
# 2. Run gpg --fingerprint

# /home/vagrant/.gnupg/pubring.gpg

# IMPORTANT
# Please build your package locally using pdebuild and 
# proceed further only if there are no errors.
